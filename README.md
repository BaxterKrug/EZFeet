# EZFeetEZ Feet
EZ Feet are a simple, 3D printable model that allows users to easily and cheaply create new cases and hardware mounts for older machines that may have broken housings. The spacing is designed such that, rather than hard-mounting the plastic directly to the PCB (which may be non-standard), old shipping foam or store-bought EVA foam is used to keep things secure.
Installation
To use EZ Feet, you will need access to a 3D printer and the files. You can download the files to print directly from this repository, or you can visit the TinkerCad link to access an easily editable version.
Usage
To use EZ Feet, simply print the model and attach it to your desired machine using screws or other appropriate hardware. You can also use the TinkerCad version to modify the model to fit your specific needs.
Known Issues
Currently, the design allows the user to rotate the feet after mounting to the casing. This could be remedied with a second hole at the base.
